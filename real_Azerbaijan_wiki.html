Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime. }}</ref> under a [[hereditary dictatorship]]

In the first half of the 7th century, Caucasian Albania, as a vassal of the Sasanians, came under nominal Muslim rule with the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] repulsed both the Sasanians and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] from the [[South Caucasus]] and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after Christian resistance led by King [[Juansher]] was suppressed in 667. The power vacuum left by the decline of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the [[Sallarid dynasty|Sallarids]], [[Sajid dynasty|Sajids]], and [[Shaddadids]]. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by the waves of migrating [[Oghuz Turks]] from Central Asia, who adopted a [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkoman]] [[ethnonym]] at the time.<ref>Barthold, V.V. ''Sochineniya''; p. 558: "Whatever the former significance of the Oghuz people in Eastern Asia, after the events of the 8th and 9th centuries, it focuses more and more on the West, on the border of the Pre-Asian cultural world, which was destined to be invaded by the Oghuz people in the 11th century, or, as they were called only in the west, by the Turkmen."</ref> The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the [[Seljuk Empire]], which entered the area by 1067.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPrjCwAAQBAJ&q=Tughril+and+Chaghri+Seljuk+Empire&pg=PA6|title=Court and Cosmos: The Great Age of the Seljuqs|last1=Canby|first1=Sheila R.|last2=Beyazit|first2=Deniz|last3=Rugiadi|first3=Martina|last4=Peacock|first4=A.

[[Shirvanshahs]], the local dynasty of Arabic origin that was later Persianized, became a vassal state of [[Timurid Empire]] of [[Timur]] and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Tokhtamysh]]. Following Timur's death, two independent and rival Turkoman states emerged: [[Qara Qoyunlu]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu]]. The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining for numerous centuries to come a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals as they had done since 861. In 1501, the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran subdued the Shirvanshahs and gained its possessions.

Since independence in 1991, the government has taken measures to preserve the [[environment of Azerbaijan]]. National protection of the environment accelerated after 2001 when the state budget increased through revenues provided by the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]]. Within four years, protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country's territory.

Azerbaijan is home to a wide variety of landscapes. Over half of the land consists of mountain ridges, crests, highlands, and plateaus which rise up to levels of 400–1,000&nbsp;meters (including the middle and lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100–120&nbsp;meters, and others from 0–50&nbsp;meters and up ([[Qobustan, Absheron]]). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consists of plains and lowlands.

Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan; they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period. This is evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human-introduced industrial activities. Canals and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. In terms of water supply, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately {{convert|100000|m3|0|abbr=off}} per year of water per square kilometer.<ref name="KL"/> All big [[Reservoir|water reservoirs]] are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan belongs to the Caspian Sea basin.

The [[Kura (South Caucasus river)|Kura]] and [[Aras (river)|Aras]] are the major rivers in Azerbaijan. They run through the [[Kura-Aras lowland]]. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and Talysh Mountains and run along the Samur–Devechi and Lankaran lowlands.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/major-rivers-of-azerbaijan.html |title=Major Rivers Of Azerbaijan |author=Joyce Chepkemoi |date=25 April 2017 |website=worldatlas.com |access-date=23 November 2020 |archive-date=2 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201202010451/https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/major-rivers-of-azerbaijan.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>FAO. 2009.

The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks, and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on flora and fauna of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century.<ref name="GEO"/>

There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians, and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan.<ref name="GEO"/> The national animal of Azerbaijan is the [[Karabakh horse]], a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance, and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world, but today the horse is an endangered species.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Karabakh Horse| publisher = Karabakh Foundation| url = http://www.karabakhfoundation.org/pages/history-and-culture/karabakh-region/the-karabakh-horse/| url-status=dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101013010330/http://karabakhfoundation.org/pages/history-and-culture/karabakh-region/the-karabakh-horse/| archive-date = 13 October 2010}}</ref>

Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of higher plants. Due to the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus. Sixty-six percent of the species growing in the whole [[Caucasus]] can be found in Azerbaijan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Planting/_planting_e.html |title=Azerbaijan – Flora |publisher=Heydar Aliyev Foundation |access-date=5 March 2010 |archive-date=1 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701231420/http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Planting/_planting_e.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The country lies within four ecoregions: [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests]], [[Caucasus mixed forests]], [[Eastern Anatolian montane steppe]], and [[Azerbaijan shrub desert and steppe]].<ref name="DinersteinOlson2017">{{cite journal|last1=Dinerstein|first1=Eric|last2=Olson|first2=David|last3=Joshi|first3=Anup|last4=Vynne|first4=Carly|last5=Burgess|first5=Neil D.|last6=Wikramanayake|first6=Eric|last7=Hahn|first7=Nathan|last8=Palminteri|first8=Suzanne|last9=Hedao|first9=Prashant|last10=Noss|first10=Reed|last11=Hansen|first11=Matt|last12=Locke|first12=Harvey|last13=Ellis|first13=Erle C|last14=Jones|first14=Benjamin|last15=Barber|first15=Charles Victor|last16=Hayes|first16=Randy|last17=Kormos|first17=Cyril|last18=Martin|first18=Vance|last19=Crist|first19=Eileen|last20=Sechrest|first20=Wes|last21=Price|first21=Lori|last22=Baillie|first22=Jonathan E.

The structural formation of the political system was completed by the adoption of the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|constitution]] on 12 November 1995. According to Article 23 of the constitution, the [[National symbol|state symbols]] are the [[Flag of Azerbaijan|flag]], the [[Coat of arms of Azerbaijan|coat of arms]], and the [[National Anthem of the Republic of Azerbaijan|national anthem]]. The state power is limited only by law for internal issues, but international affairs are also limited by international agreements' provisions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.courts.gov.az/en/main/page/State-power_3056 |title=State power |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=courts.gov.az |access-date=23 November 2020 |archive-date=6 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220806154236/https://courts.gov.az/en/main/page/State-power_3056 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{better source needed|date=September 2023}}

The Constitution of Azerbaijan states that it is a presidential republic with three branches of power – executive, legislative, and judicial. The legislative power is held by the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]] and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The [[National Assembly (Azerbaijan)|Parliament of Azerbaijan]], called Milli Majlis, consists of 125 deputies elected based on [[First-past-the-post voting|majority vote]], with a term of five years for each elected member. The elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The Parliament is not responsible for the formation of the government, but the constitution requires the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers by Milli Majlis.<ref>(Constitution of Azerbaijan Republic, Articles 104–107)</ref> The New Azerbaijan Party, and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the [[2010 Azerbaijani parliamentary election|2010 Parliamentary election]], the opposition parties, [[Musavat]] and [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]], failed to win a single seat. European observers [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Campaign irregularities|found numerous irregularities]] in the run-up to the election and on election day.<ref>{{cite news|title=Monitors criticize Azerbaijani elections |publisher=[[Al Jazeera Media Network|Al Jazeera]] |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html |access-date=8 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111072636/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html |archive-date=11 November 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The executive power is held by the [[President of Azerbaijan|president]], who is elected for a seven-year term by direct elections, and the [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|prime minister]]. The president is authorized to form the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet]], a collective executive body accountable to both the president and the National Assembly.<ref name="LaPorte2016" /> The Cabinet consists primarily of the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers. The [[8th Government of Azerbaijan]] is the administration in its current formation. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly but has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]], and the Economic Court. The president nominates the judges in these courts.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Azerbaijan's system of governance nominally can be called two-tiered. The top or highest tier of the government is the executive power headed by president. The local executive authority is merely a continuation of executive power. The provision determines the legal status of local state administration on local executive authority (''Yerli Icra Hakimiyati''), adopted 16 June 1999. In June 2012, the president approved a regulation which granted additional powers to local executive authorities, strengthening their dominant position in local affairs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Azərbaycan Prezidentinin Rəsmi internet səhifəsi |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az |access-date=22 December 2018 |archive-date=8 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220908010300/https://president.az/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the constitution.

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in April 2017 that "Azerbaijan's ruling elite operated a secret $2.9bn (£2.2bn) scheme to pay prominent Europeans, buy luxury goods and launder money through a network of opaque British companies .... Leaked data shows that the Azerbaijani leadership, accused of serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and rigging elections, made more than 16,000 covert payments from 2012 to 2014. Some of this money went to politicians and journalists, as part of an international lobbying operation to deflect criticism of Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, and to promote a positive image of his oil-rich country."

The [[culture of Azerbaijan]] has developed as a result of many influences; that is why Azerbaijanis are, in many ways, bi-cultural. National traditions are preserved despite Western influences, including globalized consumer culture. For example, [[Novruz in Azerbaijan|Novruz Bayram]] is a family holiday derived from the traditional celebration of the New Year in [[Zoroastrianism]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Waters| first = Zena| title = What exactly is Novruz Bayram| publisher = Azerbaijan Today| url = http://www.azerbaijantoday.az/ARCHIVE/12/life1.html| access-date = 22 March 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110514214646/http://www.azerbaijantoday.az/ARCHIVE/12/life1.html| archive-date = 14 May 2011}}</ref>

Azerbaijani national and traditional dresses are the [[chokha]] and [[papakhi]]. There are radio broadcasts in Russian, [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]] and [[Talysh language|Talysh]] languages, which are financed from the state budget.<ref name="MIN"/> Some local radio stations in [[Balakən|Balakan]] and [[Khachmaz (city)|Khachmaz]] organize broadcasts in [[Avar language|Avar]] and [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]].<ref name="MIN"/> In Baku several newspapers are published in Russian, Kurdish (''Dengi Kurd''), Lezgian (''Samur'') and Talysh languages.<ref name="MIN"/> Jewish society "Sokhnut" publishes the newspaper ''Aziz''.<ref name="MIN"/>

The task for modern Azerbaijani architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment.

[[Azerbaijani art]] is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as [[Repoussé and chasing|chasing]], jeweling, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone, or bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, and knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here.

The ''[[Book of Dede Korkut]]'' consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century,<ref name="Meeker">Michael E. Meeker, "The Dede Korkut Ethic", International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Aug. 1992), 395–417. excerpt: The Book of Dede Korkut is an early record of oral Turkic folktales in Anatolia, and as such, one of the mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves "Turcoman" rather than "Oghuz," had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether.</ref> and was not written earlier than the 15th century.<ref name="Kafadar">Cemal Kafadar(1995), "in Between Two Worlds: Construction of the Ottoman states", University of California Press, 1995.
